# Advances CSS Portfolio Challange, Created by Jeancarlos Mulet w/  🙌 The University of Miami 🙌

**Version 1.0.0** 

## Description 
For this challenge I was instructed to create a Portfolio using advance CSS features

The Criteria was:

- GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work

*WHEN I load their portfolio
*THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
*WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
*THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
*WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
*THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
*WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
*THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
*WHEN I click on the images of the applications
*THEN I am taken to that deployed application
*WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
*THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
